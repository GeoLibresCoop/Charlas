Here's a sample formula you can use to give it a try:
f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty
    \hat f(\xi)\,e^{2 \pi i \xi x}
    \,d\xi

KaTeX
All math typesetting is made possible thanks to the KaTeX open source project. For a full list of supported TeX functions please see this page in the KaTeX docs:

Inline math
It's also possible to include math inline as part of a text block. To do this, you'll need to wrap your formula with one of the following delimiters:
- \( inline math here \)
- \[ display math here \]
- $$ display math here $$

The \( \) wrapper renders your math inline with no line break, while \[ \] and $$ $$ both show math in "display" mode on its own line.
